# DaVinciResolveTimelineFlag
A DaVinci Resolve script to flag clips in the timeline using a property filter.

Tested on MacOS Sonoma with DaVinci Resolve 18.6 and Python 3.11.5.

Drop the script into `/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Fusion/Scripts/Comp` and make sure you have Python3 installed from https://www.python.org/downloads/ (a Brew installation will not work).
